                    Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. 
                    Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals,
                    and all algae and fungi were treated as plants.

                        <b>Fact-No-1</b><br>
                        Plants are the only living species that can 
                        manufacture their own food and this is mainly 
                        because of the presence of specialized structures 
                        in the plant cell. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <b>Fact-No-2</b><br>
                        The shape of plants and trees are triangular because
                        they need more sunlight to carry out the process of 
                        photosynthesis. Therefore, the shape of plants and 
                        trees are in such a way that they get the maximum 
                        amount of sunlight.

                        <b>Fact-No-3</b><br>
                        Plants absorb nutrients through their roots. They 
                        require nutrients and water up through the stem 
                        to the parts that are above ground level.

                        <b>Fact-No-4</b><br>
                        Nutrition in Plants is both through the autotrophic 
                        and heterotrophic mode of nutrition. Plants with 
                        chlorophyll pigments in their cells synthesise their 
                        food. Plants, which lack chlorophyll pigments, depend 
                        on autotrophic plants for their food. These plants 
                        are called heterotrophic plants.

                        <b>Fact-No-5</b><br>
                        Photosynthesis is the process of synthesis of food 
                        by green plants, which usually occurs in plants 
                        with green leaves.
